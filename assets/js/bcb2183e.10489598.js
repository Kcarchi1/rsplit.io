Inc. (\u201cAEye\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: LIDR), a global leader in adaptive, high performance lidar solutions, today announced that the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) has approved a 1-for-30 reverse stock split (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d) of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), that is expected to become effective on Tuesday, December 26, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d). The Common Stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) under the symbol \u201cLIDR\u201d and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis commencing upon market open on December 27, 2023. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split will be 008183204. The Company\u2019s publicly traded warrants will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cLIDRW.\u201d However, under the terms of the applicable warrant agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be proportionately decreased.\\n\\n \\nThe Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders held on December 12, 2023, where the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the amendments to the Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCharter\u201d), to effect the Reverse Stock Split at such reverse stock split ratio (in multiples of five to one ratio between and including five and fifty) and granted the Board the authority to determine the final reverse stock split ratio and when to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split. Subsequently, the Board approved the Reverse Stock Split and filing of the amendment to the Charter to effect the Reverse Stock Split, at the ratio of 1-for-30, as of the Effective Time. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 30 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding will be automatically combined into one share of Common Stock and proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Company\u2019s outstanding equity awards, the public warrants trading on Nasdaq under the existing symbol \u201cLIDRW,\u201d private warrants and the number of shares issuable under its equity incentive plans and other existing agreements, as well as the exercise or conversion price, as applicable. There will be no change to the number of authorized shares or the par value per share.\\n\\n \\nNo fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any stockholders who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will receive cash payments in lieu of such fractional shares.\\n\\n \\n\u201cAfter evaluating alternatives, we determined that a reverse stock split was the best course of action to bring the Company in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirements, and our stockholders agreed,\u201d said Matt Fisch, AEye CEO. \u201cWe believe remaining listed on Nasdaq gives us the liquidity and visibility necessary to attract a broader segment of the investment community. This strategic move is intended to remove the ambiguity around our listing and put us in a stronger position to enhance stockholder value as we execute against our automotive-first strategy.\u201d\\n\\n \\nINFORMATION FOR LIDR STOCKHOLDERS\\n\\n \\nThe Company has chosen its transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., to act as exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of Common Stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares and/or any cash in lieu of fractional shares (if applicable). Such stockholders will automatically receive, either via email or at your address of record, a transaction statement from our transfer agent indicating the number of post-Reverse Stock Split shares held following the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split.\\n\\n \\nThose stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or in \u201cstreet name\u201d will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split and any cash in lieu of fractional shares (as applicable) will be automatically issued to such stockholders through their broker, subject to each brokers\u2019 particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\\n\\n \\nAdditional information about the Reverse Stock Split and the related Charter amendment can be found in the Company\u2019s definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on October 31, 2023.

(\u201cVersus\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: VS) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-16 reverse split of its common shares (the \u201cConsolidation\u201d) to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements. The Consolidation is effective as of the close of trading on December 28, 2023. As a result of the Consolidation, every 16 common shares of the Company will be converted into one common share, reducing the number of issued and outstanding common shares from approximately 40.1 million to approximately 2.5 million. No fractional common shares will be issued in connection with the Consolidation, and any fractional shares created as a result of the Consolidation will be rounded to the nearest whole common share. The number of Versus\u2019 common shares issuable upon vesting or the exercise of equity awards, such as stock options and other derivative securities, along with the corresponding exercise prices thereof, will each be proportionally adjusted. Versus expects its common shares to commence trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the open of trading on December 29, 2023. A letter of transmittal will be sent by mail to shareholders advising them that the Consolidation has taken effect and instructing them to surrender the certificates evidencing their common shares for replacement certificates representing the number of common shares to which they are entitled as a result of the Consolidation. Until surrendered, each certificate formerly representing common shares will be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of common shares to which the holder thereof is entitled as a result of the Consolidation. The Company\u2019s common shares will trade under a new CUSIP number 92535P873 following the effectiveness of the Consolidation.
